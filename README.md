Author: Isabela B. Castro (isabelabezerra2@gmail.com) 

This data set was presented in the article "Ecological legacies in a tropical savanna: woody layer responses to long-term changes in soil chemistry", by Castro and collaborators. 
We collected traits from a Brazilian savanna known as Cerrado. 

SP = Species 
TRAT = Nutrient treatment plot (N = nitrogen; P = phosphorus; NP = nitrogen + phosphorus; Ca = liming)
H = Height (not used in further analysis) (m)
SLA = Specific leaf area (cmÂ²g-1)
LT = Leaf thickness (mm)
LDMC = Leaf dry matter content (g g-1)
N and P = foliar N and P content (g/kg)
